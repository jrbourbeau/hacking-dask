    "## Components of a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dask cluster is composed of three different types of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scheduler**: A single, centralized scheduler process which responds to requests for computations, maintains relavant state about tasks and worker, and sends tasks to workers to be computed.\n",
    "2. **Workers**: One or more worker processes which compute tasks and store/serve their results.\n",
    "3. **Clients**: One or more client objects which are the user-facing entry point to interact with the cluster.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/dask-cluster.png\"\n",
    "     width=\"90%\"\n",
    "     alt=\"Dask components\\\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of notes about workers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each worker runs in its own Python process. Each worker Python process has its own `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` which is uses to compute tasks in parallel. The same threads vs. processes considerations we discussed earlier also apply to Dask workers.\n",
    "- There's actually a fourth cluster object which is often not discussed: the **Nanny**. By default Dask workers are launched and managed by a separate nanny process. This separate process allows workers to restart themselves if you want to use the `Client.restart` method, or to restart workers automatically if they get above a certain memory limit threshold.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deploying a Dask cluster means launching scheduler, worker, and client processes and setting up the appropriate network connections so these processes can communicate with one another. Dask clusters can be lauched in a few different ways which we highlight in the following sections.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we'll siscuss Dask's scheduler and worker plugin systems and write our own plugin to extend the scheduler's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've primarily focused on inspecting the state of a cluster. However, there are times when it's useful to extend the functionality of the scheduler and/or workers in a cluster. To help facilitate this, Dask has scheduler and worker plugin systems which enable you to hook into different events that happen throughout a cluster's lifecycle. This allows you to run custom code when a specific type of event occurs on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the [scheduler plugin system](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/plugins.html#scheduler-plugins) enables you run custom code when the following events occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scheduler starts, stops, or is restarted\n",
    "2. Client connects or disconnects to the scheduler\n",
    "3. Workers enters or leaves the cluster\n",
    "4. When a new task enters the scheduler\n",
    "5. When a task changes state (e.g. from \"processing\" to \"memory\")\n",
    "\n",
    "While the [worker plugin system](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/plugins.html#worker-plugins) enables you run custom code when the following events occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Worker starts or stops\n",
    "2. When a worker releases a task\n",
    "3. When a task changes state (e.g. \"processing\" to \"memory\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing your own custom plugin consists of creating a Python class with certain methods (each method corresponds to a particular lifecycle event)."
