    "# Advanced Collections: _Custom Operations_\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithms that are pre-defined for different types of Dask collections\n",
    "(such as Arrays, DataFrames and Bags). Sometimes for more niche use-cases, these predefined\n",
    "algorithms are not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can wrap arbitrary functions in ``dask.delayed`` to parallelize them,\n",
    "but when you are operating on a Dask collection or several Dask collections,\n",
    "``dask.delayed`` won't understand the organization of your blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases there are several different ways in which you can set up\n",
    "custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   All collections have a ``map_partitions`` or ``map_blocks`` function, that\n",
    "    applies a user provided function across every Pandas dataframe or NumPy array\n",
    "    in the collection.  Because Dask collections are made up of normal Python\n",
    "    objects, it's often straightforward to map custom functions across partitions of a\n",
    "    dataset without much modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   More complex ``map_*`` functions.  Sometimes your custom behavior isn't\n",
    "    embarrassingly parallel, but requires more advanced communication.  For\n",
    "    example maybe you need to communicate a little bit of information from one\n",
    "    partition to the next, or maybe you want to build a custom aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dask collections include methods for these as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For even more complex workloads you can convert your collections into\n",
    "    individual blocks, and arrange those blocks as you like using Dask Delayed.\n",
    "    There is usually a ``to_delayed`` method on every collection. Note that this\n",
